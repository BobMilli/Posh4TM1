Powershell Module for TM1 administration tasks


## Introduction

This repo will host a Powershell module I've done in order to do any kind of IBM Cognos TM1 administration tasks:
* Get Chore details without unactivate them,
* Run a TI process 
* Get an average TM1 Database starting time
* ... and many other tasks that I'll add later on

I know that there already a **tremendous** solution for TM1 administration ran from command line, [TM1py](https://github.com/cubewise-code/tm1py), but my point is that Python isn't already available as a default shell on Windows systems. Powershell is a standard shell for Windows so, grab this module and you're done, you can start !
